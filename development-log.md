20-September: Searched and tested APIs, read API documentation, set up python development environment and github workspace
21-September: Searched for cities database. Revised decorators and CI/CD content, test deployed CI/CD workflow
22-September: Successfully pushed first CI workflow into GitHub; Spent a whole day figuring out csv file handling to import a city database in csv into app; wrote functions to convert and save required data in json format; started writing test for file_handler class; Could not figure out how to use decorator to create and delete test file for file handling functions, resorted to the good old way of writing separate methods and calling them separately.
