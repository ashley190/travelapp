19-September: Idea approved by senior dev
20-September: Searched and tested APIs, read API documentation, set up python development environment and github workspace
21-September: Searched for cities database. Revised decorators and CI/CD content, test deployed CI/CD workflow
22-September: Successfully pushed first CI workflow into GitHub; Spent a whole day figuring out csv file handling to import a city database in csv into app; wrote functions to convert and save required data in json format; started writing test for file_handler class; Could not figure out how to use decorator to create and delete test file for file handling functions, resorted to the good old way of writing separate methods and calling them separately.
23-September: Completed data extraction from csv file; searched and implemented selection menu for countries and cities
24-September: Used Mock to automate test user input for country and city selection!
25-September: Incredibly frustrating day. Couldn't figure out issue with test_places_selection in test_places_db. Spent too much time over the problem. Unittest would pass in local environment but throws up different process and import errors on CI workflow when pushing to github.
